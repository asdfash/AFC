## Week 1

### Syscon recap

1. Any control algrothm can be arragned in the form G(S).
2. D(S) is called the characteristic function.
3. n shows the order of the system.
4. Laplace transform only good for LTI system
5. You want to convert to $\dfrac{A}{Bs+1}$ for first order systems

6. CLTF $ = \dfrac{C(s)}{R(s)} =\dfrac{G(s)}{1+G(s)H(s)} $

state at time  $ 0 \neq 0 $  
For controlability, is A and B  
For observability, is A and C
